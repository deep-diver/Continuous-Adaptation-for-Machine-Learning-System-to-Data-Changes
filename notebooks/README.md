--- | --- | --- | 
01_Dataset_Prep.ipynb | Download CIFAR10 TFRecord from TFDS(TensorFlow Dataset) and upload it to GCS Bucket. It makes sure the directory structure follows `/span-{SPAN}/[train\|val]/*.tfrecord` format | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/01_Dataset_Prep.ipynb)
02_TFX_Training_Pipeline.ipynb | Build TFX pipeline that can be run on Vertex AI Pipeline. `ExampleGen`, `Trainer`, and `Pusher` components are included | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/02_TFX_Training_Pipeline.ipynb)
03_Batch_Prediction_Pipeline.ipynb | Build KFP pipeline that runs batch prediction on the trained model obtained from `02_TFX_Training_Pipeline.ipynb`. Then the `TFX Training Pipeline` gets triggered based on the evaluation of the predicted results | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/03_Batch_Prediction_Pipeline.ipynb)
04_Cloud_Scheduler_Trigger.ipynb | Create/Publish Pub/Sub topic, and deploy Cloud Function listening to the Pub/Sub topic to trigger the batch prediction pipeline | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/04_Cloud_Scheduler_Trigger.ipynb)
97_Prepare_Test_Images.ipynb | Download test images from [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) to simulate data drift. Downloaded images will be moved into a GCS bucket | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/97_Prepare_Test_Images.ipynb)
98_Batch_Prediction_Test.ipynb | Makes a batch prediction on a pushed model via Vertex AI Prediction. It measures the model performance (accuracy) on new data | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/98_Batch_Prediction_Test.ipynb)
