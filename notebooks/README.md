01_Dataset_Prep.ipynb | Download CIFAR10 TFRecord from TFDS(TensorFlow Dataset) and upload it to GCS Bucket. It makes sure the directory structure follows `/span-{SPAN}/[train\|val]/*.tfrecord` format | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/01_Dataset_Prep.ipynb)
02_TFX_Training_Pipeline.ipynb | Build TFX pipeline that can be run on Vertex AI Pipeline. `ExampleGen`, `Trainer`, and `Pusher` components are included | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/02_TFX_Training_Pipeline.ipynb)
03_Batch_Prediction_Performance.ipynb | Makes a batch prediction on a pushed model via Vertex AI Prediction. It measures the model performance on new data and triggers the TFX pipeline if necessary | [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-diver/Continuous-Adaptation-for-Machine-Learning-System-to-Data-Changes/blob/main/notebooks/03_Batch_Prediction_Performance.ipynb)
